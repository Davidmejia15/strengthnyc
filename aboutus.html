                        <p>About Us:</p>
                        <p>An Organization that spreads Love and Powerful messages through clothing.</p> 
                        <p>StrengthNYC was established in April 24 of 2016 in the Bronx, NY by founder David Mejia.</p>
                        <p>David was inspired by God to create this clothing line to spread the word of God and empower his people.</p>
                        <p>God gave David a vision to seek an organization to partner with and donate a portion of his profits to the Homeless.</p>
